# ToolHelper - Adds terminal controls to show the radius of ship tools

* The radius color changes based on whether the tool is idle, active, or incomplete.
* The keybind `Alt + =` will toggle between showing normal and right-click drill radius.
* You can use `/th clear` to quickly disable the visuals without going through the terminal.
* There is also `/th toggle drills` as an alternative way to switch between showing normal and right-click drill radius.
